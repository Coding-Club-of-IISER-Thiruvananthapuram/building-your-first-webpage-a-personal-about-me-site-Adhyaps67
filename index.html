    <h1>Hello, I'm Adhya!</h1>
    
    <p>I am a <strong>first-year undergraduate student at IISER Thiruvananthapuram</strong>, originally from <strong>Trivandrum, Kerala</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy <strong>drawing</strong>, especially portraits of personalities. Sometimes I also draw using <strong>MS Paint</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>After coming to IISER, I developed an interest in <strong>photography</strong>. I have covered around <strong>33 events</strong> so far, including <strong>ISHYA</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>I am currently doing an <strong>internship under Prof. Rajeev Kini</strong> in the <strong>Ultrafast Spectroscopy Lab</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>These days, I’m working on <strong>presentations</strong>, reading <strong>research papers</strong>, <strong>theses</strong>, and <strong>review articles</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>I’m excited to <strong>dive deeper into ultrafast phenomena</strong> in the coming days!</p>
