    <h1>Hi, My name is Adhya</h1>

    <p>I'm a first-year undergraduate at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, originally from Trivandrum, Kerala.</p>

    <p>I love drawing, especially portraits, and often use MS Paint for drawing cartoon characters.</p>
    
    <p> Also in my free time I like learning languages and I've been learning Russian for 2 years. I'd say that I'm in intermedaite level.<p>
      
    <p>Since joining IISER, I’ve been active in photography and have covered over 34 events including ISHYA.</p>

    <p>I’m interning in the Ultrafast Spectroscopy Lab under Prof. Rajeev Kini. As of now I have done exfoliation and found some monolayers and did pick up of an exfoliated flake and working on stacking to form hetero structure.  I'm spending my time now in reading papers, review articles, and making presentations.</p>

    <p>I hope to go deeper into ultrafast behavior of these systems in coming days.</p>
