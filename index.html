    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Adhya. I am a first-year undergraduate student at IISER Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
    <p>I am from Trivandrum, Kerala. In my free time, I enjoy drawing — especially portraits of personalities. I also like to experiment with art using MS Paint.</p>
    <p>After joining IISER, I picked up photography. I've covered around 33 events, including ISHYA, as part of the photography team.</p>
    <p>I’m currently doing an internship under Prof. Rajeev Kini in the Ultrafast Spectroscopy Lab. My work involves making presentations, reading research papers, theses, and review articles.</p>
    <p>In the future, I’d like to explore the ultrafast behavior of materials in greater depth.</p>
